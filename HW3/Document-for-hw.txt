In this homework, I ran some packages with LR,RF, and GBM. 

First, for the raw data, the column I want to work with is leveled by ">50K" and "<=50K". Since the data might not be large enough for my later practise, I combined another set of data so that I have around 50000 obversations to work with. 

For the part of LR, my 'bestlambda' (= 0.0007857125) came out from the function "cv.glmnet" which is the cross-validation of glmnet. During the cross-validation process, the value of alpha was set to 1 which leads to the Lasso regularization. Comparing to other values of auc (that shows the goodness of the model) with lambda values 0 and 0.1, the auc value of the 'bestlambda' is the largest among all three values. 

For the part of RF, I changed the numbers of 'max_depth' and 'num_parallel_tree' to see the effects of auc values. As the 'max_depth' has larger value, the auc value decreases; as the 'num_parallel_tree' has smaller value, the auc value increases. Then I setup the table of prediction to calculate my accuracy rate to see if the model fits well.
